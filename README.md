This repository contains all the code for the IMDb/TMDb genre prediction based on movie metadata and movie posters. There is a folder corresponding to each of the five different milestones:
- Milestone 1: contains EDA of TMDb and IMDb databases as well as research questions
- Milestone 2: contains code to generate the movie metadata training set. The full resulting data set is in the Data_files folder and is called dataset_final.csv
- Milestone 3: contains a iPython notebook for each of our three supervised learning models (Milestone 3-SVM.ipynb, Milestone3-RandomForestClassifier.ipynb, Milestone3- Baseline Logistic Regression.ipynb) and a notebook (Milestone 3-Report.ipynb) with the overall supervised learning results 
- Milestone 4: contains two notebooks for our trained-from-scratch network (a cross-validation code, Neural Network-CV.ipynb and testing code, Neural Network.ipynb), a notebook for the pre-trained model (Milestone4- PreTrainedModel.ipynb) and a notebook for our exploratory idea (Nueral Network Exploratory.ipynb). The movie posters used in these models are in the folder "Movie Posters Resized 32x32"
- Milestone 5: contains the work since the last milestone. Specifically there is a notebook (Neural Network-Poster Results.ipynb) with code for visualizing the results of the Nueral Net and the representative posters per genre. Also, there is a notebook (Comparison of Neural Net and Traditional Machine Learning.ipynb) containing code for comparing the results of the neural network against the supervised learning results.
