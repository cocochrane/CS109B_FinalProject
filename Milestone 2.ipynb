Overview and title (using bag-of-words) may give some indication of genre (for instance, the word 'police' might indicate a crime genre). Runtime may have an interesting interaction with movie genre (e.g. perhaps Romance movies tend to be shorter than Science Fiction ones). Release date and year may show some effects (perhaps Horror is more likely for movies released in October, for instance). The average color of the pixels may give a significant amount of information (a red average may indicate a crime movie, a blue average may be a drama movie, etc.). Alot of care goes into movie poster design and colors often evoke very specific feelings that tend to relate to the genres.  \n",
